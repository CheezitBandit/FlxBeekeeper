# Beekeeper

A single player game based on one of the scenarios in the Tron arcade game, created
by Jess Geiger (Missouri State University) for CSC 303.

## Overview

You are a beekeeper, and must harvest the honey from the beehive without being stung. The bees move their hive from time to time, so you'll have to stay on your toes. The bees are also attracted to flowers, and if you find one, you can use it to distract them from stinging you.

Give it a shot!
